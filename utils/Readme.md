# DP_Quantiles 

This repository contains code for evaluating different mechanisms using various statistical distributions. The experiments compute and compare the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of multiple mechanisms under controlled conditions.

## Features

- **Mechanisms Supported**:
  - Exponential Mechanism (`EXP`)
- Centered Exponential Mechanism (`CEXP`)
- Gaussian exponential mechanism (`GEXP`)
- Randomized data Quantile Mechanism (`RQM` - with measurement error)
